      "SRGNN (Rotation Invariant Graph Neural Networks using Spin Convolutions) can be used to analyze and predict materials properties for various applications such as solar panels, transistors, photodetectors, single photon emitters, and quantum computers. By leveraging the rotation invariance and spin convolutions of SRGNN, researchers can model the atomic structures and interactions within materials to identify those with desirable properties for specific applications. This approach enables the exploration and discovery of materials that exhibit optimal characteristics for the targeted devices or systems.\n",

Several works are mentioned that have improved upon GNN models for materials, including incorporating atomic structure, correlations, and chemical representations. The high accuracy of GNNs allows for the prediction of complex property-distance correlations in 2D materials.
