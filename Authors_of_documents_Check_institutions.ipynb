The \\ncombination of high -throughput techniques and \\nrapidly advancing supercomputers enables the \\nautomated screening of large numbers of \\nhypothetical materials, providing solutions to current \\ntechnological challenges. In addition, the integration \\nof machine learning methods with density functional \\ntheory offers a powerful approach to accelerate \\nmaterials discovery. We summarise our recent \\nefforts in the discovery, characterisation and \\nunderstanding of inorganic compounds using these \\ninnovative approaches, with a particular focus on \\nmaterials for photovoltaics [2,3,4,5].  \\n \\nWhile characterising the electronic properties of bulk \\ncrystalline materials is crucial, it may not be \\nsufficient when considering electronic devices. \\nInterfaces, such as those found in transistors, light -\\nemitting diodes and solar cells, play a key role in \\nexploiting quantum processes involving electrons in \\ntailored multilayers. The ability to shape the band \\ndiagrams at interfaces opens up opportunities for \\nelectron manipulation and the development of new \\nfunctionalities. However, designing interfaces and \\ngaining a deep understanding of their properties \\npose challenges that go beyond the current state of \\nthe art. We discuss recent advances in this direction \\n[6,7].  \\n \\nReferences  \\n \\n[1] Alexandria Database. \\nhttps://alexandria.icams.rub.de/  \\n[2] J. Schmidt, N. Hoffmann, H. -C.
